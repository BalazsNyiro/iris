 Questions:
  - the BIG question: how can the user interface communicate with the main program?
    - the main program can wait for:
      - button pressings
      - text input receiving
      - selected menu items from a list:
         > <ul><li id="elemA" selectable="true">1</li><li id="elemB">2</li></ul>
         > which one is selected?
         > if a text input is active, the user can type there
     UI is running in a different thread

  - where is the cursor?
  - what if you see a menu, how do you know where are you exactly?
  - how do you receive user input text?
